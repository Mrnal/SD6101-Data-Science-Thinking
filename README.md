This repository contains a data science research project completed as part of the SD6101 Data Science Thinking course in the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) program at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. It investigates the relationship between product features and prices of e-commerce products, with a special focus on discount rates. The analysis is performed on two main datasets—Amazon and Shopee—integrating advanced data preprocessing, hypothesis testing, sentiment analysis, and recommendation system development. All experiments and technical steps are documented in Jupyter notebooks and the attached report.
